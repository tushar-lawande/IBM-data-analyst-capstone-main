# Task 4

In this assignment we will now show off our visualization skills by working with the Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2019 dataset. In this assignment we will:

1. Create a histogram to show the distribution of data.
2. Create different plots such as a scatter, bubble or boxplot. This will help visualize the relationship between features.
3. Create a pie chart, bar chart, and stacked chart to show medians and counts. This will help show the composition and comparison of data.
