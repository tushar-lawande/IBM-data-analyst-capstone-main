# Task 3

After cleaning the dataset, our next step is the analysis. In this stage, we will become more familiar with the data set and it will start to take shape. In this assignment, we will:

1. Plot a distribution curve, and histogram to identify the distribution of the dataset.
2. Find the median and outliers of particular columns.
3. Remove outliers.
4. Compute the Inter Quartile Range.
5. Find out the upper and lower bounds, and find correlations between numerical features.
6. Create a new data frame.
